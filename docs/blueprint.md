# **App Name**: Hikma

## Core Features:

- AI-Guided Reflection: Input your inner conflict, regret, question, or contradiction. Hikma generates a poetic, symbolic reflection based on your temperament (Sanguine, Choleric, Melancholic, Phlegmatic) and your estimated soul stage (nafs al-ammarah, lawwamah, mutma’innah). The result is not advice—it is a mirror of meaning. Each reflection ends with a wisdom seed: a one-line truth to carry and (Optional) A dhikr or invocation to anchor your heart. The generated text is presented as a tool for soul purification. Begin and end the conversation with peace and trying to get the user to feel peace ask questions with symbols like they are Rorschach Use archetypal images, poetic choices, or metaphor chains to infer temperament and nafs stage
- Contemplative Display: Reflections are presented in a distraction-free, centered layout, with large, calm typography. The visual space invites silence, attention, and presence. Icons or symbols gently hint at the user’s soul stage and temperament, without labeling.
- Record Your Response: After receiving Hikma’s reflection, users are prompted to write their own thoughts, ask deeper follow-up questions, and note emotional shifts or new awareness. This journaling stage is private and sacred. It reinforces self-witnessing and transformation.
- Reflection Archive: Every entry—both Hikma’s words and your own—are saved to a Reflection Ledger, organized by date, nafs stage, and temperament tag. You can revisit past sessions to trace your movement through the nafs and recognize recurring inner themes.
